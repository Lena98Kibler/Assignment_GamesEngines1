Project Title: Winter Wonderland - Procedural Winter Terrain

Class Group: DT211C/ Year 4

Description of Project:

For my project I am planning on creating a procedural terrain. The terrain will be designed to look like a winter wonderland.
I chose to do a winter inspired terrain as it will challenge me to create a snow like surface and create mountains like the 
ones you can find in Greenland. 

Another cool aspect that I am planning on adding to this project is snow falling out of the sky as well as adding spawning animals
like polar bears and penguins.
