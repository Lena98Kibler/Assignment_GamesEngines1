## Project Title: Winter Wonderland
Name: Lena Kibler

Student Number: C18499016

Class Group: DT211C / Year 4

## Description of the project
The project within this GitHub Repository consits of a procedurally generated terrain as well as various different 3D Models. The theme of this project is winter and Christmas inspired with the main asset being a Santa Claus sleigh that is programmed using C# to fly accross the terrain using user keyboard input. The addition of christmas audio is used in this project to further support the Christmas theme and to tie the project together into one cohesive scene. Originally the project was meant to only focus on the winter terrain and not Christmas, making it more of a nature scence with spawning animals and snow falling out of the sky. I feel like I have maintained some aspects of my original plan by still creating a winter feel in the project. Among the winter-mountain-like terrain there are randomly spawned giant candy canes that you can fly around to see up close but don't attempt to lick them !!. In addition to the candycanes there are also randomly spawned gift boxes falling out of the sky and tumbling amongst the moutains. When you look up and ahead into the star filled sky, you can notice the northern lights on display (also known as Aurora Borealis) creating an awe inspiring animation.
